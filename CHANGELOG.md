# V1.1 Beta Permutations

## V1.1.3
* Books have AI generated stories that match the buff the book provides. 
* Fixed the buffs not applying after the 1.9.51 Starfield Update.
* Jump Boost has been removed from the green flash will be added as a separate buff later

## V1.1.1 (BETA)
* Removed dependence on Books Revamped these legendary books can't be spawn open world. 
* Added tracking variables and recipes at 5 collected you get a potion recipe from Cora that is short duration and small magnitude. Will increase again at 10, 25, and cap at 50.
* After 6 hours (not sure if it is in game or real world) you will get a pop up letter from Cora asking you to use the attached treasure map to find a legendary book and return it to her. Only 1 quest will run at a time. 
* The return it part isn't working correctly right now. I think long term I will move the books/keywords to Venpi Core so Cora Wants Books can consume them too. 

## V1.1.0 (BETA)
* Book Hunts are random quest generator is functional but as usual Cora is being a spoiled teen and refusing to send out the book hunt data slates. For now, for testing use the console command [CGF "CoraTheBookHunter_DebugScript.Debug_GetBookHunt"] minus the brackets.
* Books when read will give the player a random duration buff. Available buffs Max Damage Resist, Damage Reflection, Speed/Jump Boost, more to come.
